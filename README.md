Refactoring existing code for website without changing the code

The customer asked if I could update this code to be more semantic and condensed. I started by updating the div tags to reflect what was shown on the webpage.

On images I added alt tags to better describe what is on the screen.
After updating the index the css needed to be updated to save lines of code and be easier for people to find what they need.

The .benefits took over many of the other classes that were repeating code.

The same went for the .contents class.

The code functions the same as when I recieved the code and the css/index is the most consolidated that I could make it without changing the way the webpage functioned.

I could not get the screenshot of the website to work so the main image looks ,ike it is overlapping but it is just the program that I am using.
